<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
<!-- ## About -->
## About
I am a foodie and everytime I think about what I want to eat next meal after meal. I enjoy the process of exploring amazing food to make or to eat out. However, it could be exhuasting at times. Also, my mood affects what I want to eat. I want to combine my mood with food searching tools to create a whimsical and playful search engine for food to make or food to get.

# Notes & Process

I have a general idea of the wireframe of this webpage. 

Next steps: 
1. look for npm libraries and API for moods and food 
2. search for similar search engine and analyze it
3. create a data model for the information
